    <h1>Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>This project is to develop a model that can perform the prediction of diabetes of a patient.
         Here, we are using each classification algorithm (KNN, SVC, Naive Bayes, 
         Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost) on the categorical dataset
          to build a model with high accuracy and deploy it. According to the given 
          new data, the machine will predict whether the person has Diabetes or not.</p>
    <h1>Breast Cancer Prediction</h1>      
    <p>Machine Learning Algorithm on Brest Cancer DatasetÂ¶ Introduction Breast cancer classification refers to the process of using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tissue mass is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features derived from medical imaging data, such as mammograms or biopsies. This classification is a critical aspect of medical diagnosis, aiding doctors in making informed decisions about patient treatment and care.

        Machine learning models are trained using historical data, where the features representing characteristics of the breast mass (such as size, shape, and texture) are associated with their corresponding diagnostic outcomes (malignant or benign). These models learn patterns from the training data and can then predict the likelihood of new, unseen cases being cancerous or non-cancerous.
        
        Accurate breast cancer classification can significantly improve early detection rates and patient outcomes. It reduces the need for unnecessary invasive procedures in cases of benign masses and ensures that malignant cases are identified promptly, leading to timely medical interventions and potentially life-saving treatments.

        
        I'm going to use following Classification Models
        
        Random Forest Classifier Logistic Regression Decision Tree Classifier To check which has the best Accuracy Scores</p>
        <h1>Spam Email Detection</h1>
        <p>A common person can receive a huge amount of emails in a day. The email user can receive
            emails from different sources related to the different day to day activities like social networking,
            files and sharing, online shopping, e billing, e commerce and applications etc. One should be
            able to differentiate between important and useful emails over spam or junk emails. Once a user
            gets exposed to the spam and malicious sources he will receive a large amount of emails from
            various unknown sources. Therefore it becomes a hectic and time consuming task for an email
            user to make a selection and difference of all the received emails, which may contain an
            important piece of data or information. The condition becomes very risky when an email client
            is trapped into a malicious act and then the security and privacy of a system could be breached.
            The email user could be trapped into a phishing act initiated by the cyber criminals. It is very
            hard to recover from such situations and most of the times an email user gets attracted to the
            spam emails and respond to them. In most of the cases the blocking and reporting of these spam
            email sources become useless, as the senders change their location continuously. One of the
            alternatives can be tracking those particular IP addresses from where an email user receives
            these spam emails, but the task becomes harder when the number of IP addresses are many but
            not fewer. And the major part is when the senders change their locations and targets. One of thesolutions to the email spamming is to access an email id with the number of senders, classify
            and categorize the received emails into spam and non-spam emails. The classification of
            received emails can be done by using appropriate and approximate machine learning approaches
            and some autonomous algorithms.</p>
